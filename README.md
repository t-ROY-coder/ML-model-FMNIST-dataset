# ML-model-FMNIST-dataset

•	Increased the accuracy of the traditional Machine Learning model over the FMNIST dataset present in Tensorflow.keras library.

•	Done in the Google Colab environment using Tensorflow 2.0.0 API and programmed in Python.

•	Resolved Overfitting problem by introducing a dropout layer with rate 0.2 after the hidden layer and then increasing the number of training epochs to 20.

•	Accuracy of the model increased from 87% to almost 88.7%.
